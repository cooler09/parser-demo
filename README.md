# Parser Assignment
A developer has gone rampant! Before storming out the door, a developer maliciously checked in code that messed up our unit tests and code base for three of our parsing tools. Your task is now to go in and fix what they broke. Luckily we know the areas they checked code in to. The goal is to have all unit tests pass in each of the three projects.

### Fix the tests
This is the first of the three to complete. Please fix the unit tests to reflect the actual functionality. Do NOT change any of the code in the lib folder or the description of each unit test - you should only be changing unit test code.

To get started, open the file `unit-test-fixes/spec/parser_spec.rb`, then run the tests:
```
cd unit-test-fixes
rspec
```

### Fix the code
This is the second of the three to complete. Please fix the code to reflect the functionality described in the unit tests. Do NOT change any of the code in the spec folder.

To get started, open the file `code-fixes/lib/parser.rb`, then run the tests:
```
cd code-fixes
rspec
```

### Write the code
This is the third and final assignment to complete. Please implement the code to reflect the functionality described in the unit tests. Do NOT modify the class and function definitions in the lib folder and do NOT modify any code in the spec folder. You should add functionality to the parse_data function in the lib folder.

To get started, open the file `implement-code/lib/parser.rb`, then run the tests:
```
cd implement-code
rspec
```
