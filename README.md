# Parser Assignment
A developer has gone rampant! Before storming out the door, a developer maliciously checked in code that messed up our unit tests and code base for three of our parsing tools. Your task is now to go in and fix what they broke. Luckily we know the areas they checked code in to. The goal is to have all unit tests pass in each of the three projects.

### Parser One
This is the first of the three to complete. Please fix the unit tests to reflect the described functionality. Do NOT change any of the code in the lib folder or the description of each unit test, you should only be changing unit test's code.

Location: "unit-test-fixes" folder

### Parser Two
This is the second of the three to complete. Please fix the code to reflect the functionality described in the unit tests. Do NOT change any of the code in the spec folder.

Location: "code-fixes" folder

### Parser Three
This is the third and final assignment to complete. Please implement the code to reflect the functionality described in the unit tests. Do NOT modify the class and function definitions in the lib folder and do NOT modify the spec folder as well, only add functionality to the parse_data function.
